          Can an agile racing drone senses a gate in very close environment with one single RGB camera? Yes it can.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          We propose a convolutional neural network-based gate detector (GateNet) that concurrently detects gateâ€™s center, distance, and orientation with respect to the drone using only images from a single fish-eye RGB camera. GateNet achieves a high inference rate (up to 60Hz) on an onboard processor (Jetson TX2). Moreover, GateNet is robust to gate pose changes and background disturbances. The proposed perception pipeline leverages a fish-eye lens with a wide field-of-view and thus can detect multiple gates in close range, allowing a longer planning horizon even in tight environments.

              How can an autonomous car navigate in a GPS-denied environment? Visual-inertial odometry is the key.
            description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
              In this work we engineered a Visual-inertial odometry system that composes of multiple IMU-camera systems and sensor fusion to enable an autonomous car drives independent of GPS and other external localization system. The system runs an enhanced version of Robust Visual Inertial Odometry ((Rovio)[https://github.com/ethz-asl/rovio]) enable the car to robustly navigate the environment using only local information.

          Solving autonomous navigation for agile robotic systems
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            My goal is to re-innovate autonomous path planning and navigation with the help of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and advanced Computer Vision technologies in perception and state estimation. My research involves developing novel software and algorithms, occasionally engineering new platforms, for light-weight quadrotors, equipped with visual sensors and small onboard computers while flying at high-speed in challenging scenarios. Potential applications could be in Autonomous Drone Racing, Search and Rescues, and reconnaissance missions in dynamic or unstructured environments.

        #   During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

        #   I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
