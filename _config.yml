          Can robots learn more efficient? The answer may come from novel neuromorphic cameras.

          Together with my MS student Kristoffer Andersen, I propose an autonomous drone system that leverages an event-based camera and a novel deep learning architecture based on gated recurrent units and sparse convolutions to effectively perceive racing gates in difficult visual conditions at very high speeds and low illumination.
          We also prove that the sim-to-real transfer learning scheme significantly improves the accuracy of the robot's perception module.

          Can an agile racing drone senses a gate in very close environment with one single RGB camera? Yes! I built an entire hardware system and software pipeline to prove it.

          I propose a convolutional neural network-based gate detector for drone racing (GateNet) that concurrently detects gateâ€™s center, distance, and orientation with respect to the drone using only images from a single fish-eye RGB camera. GateNet achieves a high inference rate (up to 60Hz) on an onboard processor (Jetson TX2). Moreover, GateNet is robust to gate pose changes and background disturbances. The proposed perception pipeline leverages a fish-eye lens with a wide field-of-view and thus can detect multiple gates in close range, allowing a longer planning horizon even in tight environments.
          I implement a geometric controller to control the drone and an optimization-based minimum-snap trajectory generation method for local motion planning.

          How can an autonomous car navigate in a GPS-denied environment? Visual-inertial odometry is the key.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          <img style="float: left;" src="images/autonomos_car.png"> 

          In this work, I engineer a visual-inertial odometry framework that composes of multiple IMU-camera systems and sensor fusion to enable an autonomous car drive independent of GPS and other external localization sources. The system runs an enhanced version of the Robust Visual Inertial Odometry ([Rovio](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rovio)) to robustly navigate the environment using only local information capturing from the cameras and ego-motion estimation from IMUs.

          Solving autonomous navigation for agile robotic systems
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            My goal is to re-innovate autonomous navigation and motion planning for robot systems with the help of Deep Learning. My research involves developing novel software and algorithms, occasionally also engineering new robot platforms, for agile quadrotors, equipped with visual sensors and small onboard computers flying at high speed in challenging scenarios. Potential applications could be Autonomous Drone Racing, Search and Rescues, and reconnaissance missions in dynamic or unstructured environments.

          Doing my Ph.D. at Aarhus University, Denmark is one of the best experiences I have ever had. Here I have the opportunities to work with talented researchers in a world-class facility and a supportive environment. During this time I have developed my skills and attitude to be an independent researcher and thinker, capable of leading my research projects and, in the future, my own lab.

          This is the place where I have learned Robotics! As a research assistant and later a lab engineer, I have worked on a few projects in different labs. I have worked with state-of-the-art path planning and state estimation frameworks for both aerial robots and ground robots, from individual missions to collaborative team missions. I have used both model-based and model-free methods for my work, and the knowledge and skills I have acquired during this time are essential for my career.

          I came to the university under a prestigious US government scholarship, the Vietnam Education Foundation (VEF), to study Industrial and System Engineering. I managed to do well in this new horizon and acquired valuable experiences, particularly in solving convex and non-convex optimization problems, that I still rely upon today.
